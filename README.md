Declutter, focus on most used actions, collapses seldom used ones, easier title scanning.

## Install
[Userscript][1] - [Firefox][2] - [Chrome][3].


## Why
This used to have a LOT of improvements, but at last google saw the light and incrementally made things better.

- moves the top bar (All, Videos, News...) to the sidebar
  - less focus on unused actions, easier access to "Filter by Year"
- old style links
  - easier to ignore when scanning titles
- hides "rich search content" (Top stories...)
  - gets in the way of what is really being searched
- adds toggle results in english/all languages
  - set english or native as default and then use this to quick switch between them
